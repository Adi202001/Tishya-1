# Social Network Backend

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a robust backend system for a social networking platform, designed to handle user interactions, project collaborations, and institutional affiliations. It provides a GraphQL API for seamless integration with front-end applications.

## 2. Technology Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- GraphQL (Apollo Server)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (for caching)
- Docker

## 4. Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-network-backend.git
   cd social-network-backend
   

2. Install dependencies:
   
   npm install
   

3. Set up environment variables (see section 6).

4. Install Docker and Docker Compose if not already installed.

## 5. Database Configuration
The project uses PostgreSQL. The database configuration is managed through environment variables and Docker Compose.

## 6. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

## 7. Running the Server
Using Docker:

docker-compose up --build

Without Docker:

npm start


The server will start on `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

## 8. API Endpoints
The GraphQL API provides a single endpoint at `/graphql`. Use GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with the API.

Example query:
graphql
query {
  getUser(id: "1") {
    username
    email
  }
}

## 9. Authentication
JWT-based authentication is implemented. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>

## 10. Models
- User
- Project
- Institution
- Post
- Comment
- Like
- Connection

## 11. User Management
- User registration
- User login
- Profile updates
- Password reset (if implemented)

## 12. Social Interactions
- Creating posts
- Commenting on posts
- Liking posts
- Connecting with other users

## 13. Project and Institution Management
- Creating projects
- Joining institutions
- Adding collaborators to projects

## 14. Search Functionality
(If implemented) Describe how users can search for other users, projects, or institutions.

## 15. Pagination
(If implemented) Describe how pagination works for lists of posts, users, etc.

## 16. Error Handling and Logging
Errors are logged using Winston. Check `error.log` and `combined.log` for detailed logs.

## 17. Testing
Run tests with:
npm test


## 18. Deployment
The application is containerized and can be deployed to any Docker-compatible hosting service.

## 19. Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## 20. Troubleshooting
- If you encounter database connection issues, ensure your PostgreSQL service is running and the credentials in `.env` are correct.
- For "address already in use" errors, ensure no other service is using port 4000, or change the port in `docker-compose.yml`.
